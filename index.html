    <header class="main">A short brief introduction about our mammal family Dogs.</header>
    <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals and loyal companions to humans for thousands of years. Scientifically known as Canis lupus familiaris, they are descendants of wolves and are known for their intelligence, trainability, and strong sense of smell. Dogs come in various breeds, each with unique sizes, appearances, and temperaments. They are commonly kept as pets, but also serve in roles like guarding, herding, guiding the visually impaired, and detecting substances in security work. Known for their loyalty and affection, dogs are often called "man's best friend."</p>
